FOG

Some code I made for FOG Project

- Inventory-iTalc : export your full FOG inventory to a CSV file with 
pre-made xml strings for iTalc GlobalConfig.xml file

Instruction : 
- add that file to your FOG installation in /var/www/fog/management/reports/Inventory-iTalc.php 
- it will automatically be added to your fog installation in the reports section in the toolbar
- Enjoy the clean export for iTalc !
